This file describes the structure of the cars data to be stored in DB.

Static data:
- Car makers
- Models for each car maker

Dynamic data:
- Car trims (might change very rarely)
- Prices
- Features
- Year
- Pictures

Static data needs to be fetched only once and then be saved in a database. In case of
loss of this data, it can be re-fetched. Rest of the data is either fetched or updated
based on the static data. In case of a total loss of data, the system should be able to
get static data from a reliable source and then use that to fetch rest of the data. Hence
the entire application, which relies only on the static data, is loosely coupled to
external data sources.

Data source from which static data is fetched must be reliable and not change the webpages
frequently.
Static data source: #Todo

At this point, only new cars data is fetched for that calendar year in which the application runs.
Data source(s) for dynamic data as follows.
- truecar.com

----------------------------- Dynamic data details -----------------------------
In the future, the data would be stored in an unstructured format. At this point, it is fetched and
stored in a structured format ONLY. Therefore, a rigid structure that every car details must
adhere to, is as follows:

Required fields for every car:
- Year
- Price
- Trim
- Mileage
- Type (SUV, Sedan, ...)
- Transmission

Optional fields:
- Horsepower
- Torque
- Dimensions (Length, Width, Height)
- Interior volumes (Legrooms, Trunk volume)
- Seating capacity
- Engine capacity
- Fuel tank capacity
- Fuel type
