Rules:
>>>VIN, Stock ID, Year, Trim<<<
- Get div[@id="vehicle-title1-app-root"]. There should only be one element with that path in the entire page.
- Under that there is a simple div element.
- Under that there are two elements - h1 & ul.
	- VIN is in one of the ul children. Get ul[@class="additional-details list-inline mb-0 font-weight-normal ddc-font-size-small text-muted mt-3"].
	- Pass this element over to JS executor and run a script to get $VIN text and $Stock_ID text.
	- Car name details are in the h1 element. Get h1[@class="vehicle-title m-0 line-height-reset"].
	- Pass this element over to JS executor and get $Year & $Trim text.

- Get div[@class="d-sm-inline mr-5"]/strong element. The $Location can be directly fetched from this element text.

This contains $Mileage, $Economy, $Exterior_Color, $Interior_Color, $Engine, and $Transmission data.
- Pass this element to JS. Inside the element, there are two types of tag elements - dd for values & dt for keys.
- Each dd or dt element might contain an optional children tagged 'span'. Text content can be fetched based on either directly from dd and dt tags or from
